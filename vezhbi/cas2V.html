                    ******JavaScript Statements*********
JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.   
JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. 

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.    
-Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed.
-JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
-JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
-JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
-JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.
Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword    	Description
var	        Declares a variable
let	        Declares a block variable
const	    Declares a block constant
if	        Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	    Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	        Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	Declares a function
return	    Exits a function
try	        Implements error handling to a block of statements
JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.

*********Conditional Statements***********
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

***************IF*****************
The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.

The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

*******************SWITCH-CASE***************

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.

The default Keyword
The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match.
The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block.
If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break.
Switching Details
If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.
If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.
If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.

Strict Comparison
Switch cases use strict comparison (===).
The values must be of the same type to match.
A strict comparison can only be true if the operands are of the same type.

*****************LOOPS**************************

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
Often this is the case when working with arrays.

Instead of writing:

text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";

You can write:

for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}

-Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1.for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2.for/in - loops through the properties of an object
3.for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
4.while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
5.do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

4.JavaScript While Loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

4.1.The WHILE Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

HINT: If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, 
     the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.

4.2.The DO WHILE Loop
The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);

HINT: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition,
     otherwise the loop will never end!
