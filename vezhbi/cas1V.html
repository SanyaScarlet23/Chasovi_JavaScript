        4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing
What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
When to Use JavaScript var?
Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.
When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
Declaring a JavaScript Variable
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword.
After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign.
Note
It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
One Statement, Many Variables
You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

Example
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
Value = undefined
In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:

Example
let carName;
Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

Example
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
Note
If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
JavaScript Dollar Sign $
Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

Example
let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
JavaScript Underscore (_)
Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

Example
let _lastName = "Johnson";
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.
Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

Variables defined with let must be declared before use.

Variables defined with let have block scope.
Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
Redeclaring Variables
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block.
Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block.
Redeclaring
Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program.
With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed.
The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
Cannot be Reassigned
A const variable cannot be reassigned.
Must be Assigned
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:
A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp

Constant Objects and Arrays
The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object

                       JavaScript Operators
The Addition Operator + adds numbers.
The Assignment Operator = assigns a value to a variable.

Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Assignment Operators
3.Comparison Operators
4.String Operators
5.Logical Operators
6.Bitwise Operators
7.Ternary Operators
8.Type Operators

1.JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

2.JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

Operator	Example	                       Same As
=	         x = y	                      x = y
+=	         x += y	                      x = x + y
-=	         x -= y	                      x = x - y
*=	         x *= y	                      x = x * y
/=	         x /= y	                      x = x / y
%=	         x %= y	                      x = x % y
**=	         x **= y	                  x = x ** y

3.JavaScript Comparison Operators

Operator	       Description
==	               equal to
===	               equal value and equal type
!=	               not equal
!==	               not equal value or not equal type
>	               greater than
<	               less than
>=	               greater than or equal to
<=	               less than or equal to
?	               ternary operator

5.JavaScript Logical Operators

Operator	          Description
&&	                  logical and
||	                  logical or
!	                  logical not

6.JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.
Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. 
The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.

Operator	Description	          Example
&	          AND	              5 & 1
|	           OR	              5 | 1
~	          NOT	              ~ 5
^	          XOR	              5 ^ 1
<<	        left shift	          5 << 1
>>	        right shift	          5 >> 1
>>>	    unsigned right shift	  5 >>> 1

7.Ternary Operators

8.JavaScript Type Operators
? is a ternary operator

Operator	     Description
typeof	         Returns the type of a variable
instanceof	     Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
